    Note:
    - You need to install the "Phishing URL" pack to use this automation.
    - False/True positives are possible.

    Reported emails and emails retrieved during playbook execution can contain multiple nested email files. For example, an EML nested inside another EML file.
    If multiple level files are detected, this field determines which file represents the phishing email.

    For example:
    User1 receives an email from Attacker. User1 attaches the email as an EML file and sends the email to User2.
    User2 also attaches that email as a file, and reports it as phishing. In this case, the phishing email would be the "inner file" (as opposed to "outer file").

    Possible values are: Inner file, Outer file, All files.
    Inner file: The file at the deepest level is parsed. If there is only one file, that file is parsed.
    Outer file: The file at the first level is parsed.
    All files: All files are parsed. Do not use this option in the phishing playbook, as there should only be one phishing email per playbook run.

        This playbook adds email details to the relevant context entities and handles original email attachments.

        The v2 playbook enables parsing email artifacts more efficiently, including:
        - Using incident fields and not incident labels.
        - Providing separate paths to "Phishing Alerts".
        - Using the new "Get Original Email - Generic v2" playbook to retrieve original emails as EML files from the following integrations:
          * EWS v2
          * Microsoft Graph Mail integration
          * Gmail
          * FireEye EX and FireEye CM
          * Proofpoint Protection Server
          * Agari Phishing Defense (EWS v2, MSGraph Mail, Gmail)
          * Mimecast

        This playbook is used to find, create and manage phishing campaigns. When a number of similar phishing incidents exist in the system, the playbook can be used to do the following:
        1. Find and link related incidents to the same phishing attack (a phishing campaign).
        2. Search for an existing Phishing Campaign incident, or create a new incident for the linked Phishing incidents.
        3. Link all detected phishing incidents to the Phishing Campaign incident that was found or that was created previously.
        4. Update the Phishing Campaign incident with the latest data about the campaign, and update all related phishing incidents to indicate that they are part of the campaign.

          We've concluded that the email you forwarded to us is part of a bigger phishing campaign that targeted our company. No further action is required on your part. Good job on detecting and forwarding it to us!
