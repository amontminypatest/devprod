  #### Configure Indicator Threshold Parameters
  Each indicator has a threshold parameter that impacts the indicator's DBotScore calculation.
  The indicator DBotScore is calculated based on the threshold parameter as follows:
  If the indicator `confidence` value is above the threshold parameter value, the Score is set to 3 (Malicious)
  Otherwise the DBotScore is set to 1 (Good).
  If the threshold parameter value is not specified, the DBotScore is calculated as follows:
  If the indicator `confidence` > 65, the DBotScore value is set to 3 (Malicious).
  If the indicator `confidence` is between 25 and 65, the DBotScore value is set to 2 (Suspicious).
  If the indicator `confidence` < 25, the DBotScore value is set to 1 (Good).
