  # Field Change trigger script can take an "old" and "new" and then act accordingly.
  # Can be used on fields like severity, or owner to do different actions such as escalation or notification.

  # get the old and new values of the field
  old = demisto.args().get("old").lower()
  new = demisto.args().get("new").lower()

  # get the incident ID, need to use investigationId in field change scripts
  incident = demisto.incident().get('investigationId')

  if old == "closed" and new != "closed":
      demisto.results(f"Incident {incident} status was changed from {old} to {new}")
      # could do something else like send a slack:
      # demisto.executeCommand("send-notification", {"message":"Incident {incident} reopened", "channel":"xsoar"})
